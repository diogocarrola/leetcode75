## üöÄ **How to Use This Repo**
1. **Study Order**:
   - Start with **Arrays/Hashing** ‚Üí **Two Pointers** ‚Üí **Trees** ‚Üí **Graphs** ‚Üí **DP**
   - Allocate 1-2 days per problem (30 mins solving, 30 mins reviewing solutions).

2. **For Each Problem**:
   - Try solving it yourself first.
   - If stuck after 30 mins, check the solution.
   - Annotate your code with time/space complexity:
     ```python
     # Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)
     def solve():
         """Approach: Sliding Window"""
     ```

3. **Track Progress**:
   - Update the checklist above with `[x]` when done.
   - Revisit checked problems weekly to reinforce patterns.
