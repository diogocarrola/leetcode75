## üöÄ **How to Use This Repo**
1. **Study Order**:
   - Follow the order in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for optimal learning.
   - Start with Arrays, then move to Binary, Dynamic Programming, etc.
   - Allocate 1-2 days per problem (30 mins solving, 30 mins reviewing solutions).

2. **For Each Problem**:
   - Try solving it yourself first.
   - If stuck after 30 mins, check the solution.
   - Annotate your code with time/space complexity:
     ```python
     # Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)
     def solve():
         """Approach: Sliding Window"""
     ```

3. **Track Progress**:
   - Update the progress checklist in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).
   - Review checked problems regularly to reinforce learning.

## üî• **Why These 75 Problems?**
- **Data-Driven**: Selected from top companies' interview frequency
- **Pattern-Centric**: Grouped by techniques (e.g., sliding window, DFS)
- **Time-Efficient**: Covers 90% of interview question patterns
